# Day Planner

This was an assignment to create a Day planner using CSS, Java and HTML. I wrote this using VSC (Visual Studio Code).

## Purpose

This project was to create a *Day planner* which would be responsive to the time of day and gives the user the ability to store input in their local storage.
